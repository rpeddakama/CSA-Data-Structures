/**
 * Main - entry point class for this project
 * 1.'C' and Java have a main function/method that is the ENTRY into code
 * execution. Both languages need a file to contain that ENTRY method/function.
 * Common convention for 'C': main.c. Convention for Java: Main.java.
 * 2. Replit requires a "Main.java" file and a main class ("public Class Main").
 * Inside the class it expects a method named "public static void main(String[]
 * args)"."
 * 3. Conventions and structures are part of a programming language and the
 * tools you use. Python people like to pick on these Java conventions, saying
 * they are difficult. What do you think?
