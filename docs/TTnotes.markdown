# Tech Talk Notes
Each week during our Tech Talk meeting with the teacher and crossover group, I will be taking notes here on important concepts talked about. Then, come study time, I can look at these bullet points and study stuff efficiently.

# [TT0 - Data Structures](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-0---Data-Structures)
Important Notes and Takeaways:
* A data structure is a method of organizing data. Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures.
* Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.
* Non-Primitive are Arrays, Lists (different types: linear, non-linear, stacks, graphs, queues, trees), Tuple, Dictionary, Set, File
* Imperative programming uses statements to change a program's states
* Objected Oriented Programming uses classes and objects to create objects and instances of them -> constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism

Tasks
* Create a dynamic menu perhaps using hashmap or arraylist. Rather than hard coding "case" statements.
* Swap challenge
* Matrix challenge - practicing 2D array manipulation and for loops
* All of these challenges will be encapsulated in an abstract class that makes the menu dynamic.
