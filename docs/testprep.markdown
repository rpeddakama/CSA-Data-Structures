description: Some notes on my test prep plans for this trimester
permalink: /testprep/
---

{% include navigation.md %}

* I will look at the journal I made in Trimester one that contained collegeboard notes on the test topics, information on tech talks taught in class and other things. It is very organized so it should be very easy to navigate through content and access what I want.
* In the first tri, we took many collegeboard quizzes on basic java concepts. I will go back and review these tests and primarily focus on the question I got wrong. I will see why I got them wrong, what the correct answer is, and how to avoid the mistake in the future.
* Something that will be crucial for me to do well on AP exams is participating well on the assignments assigned to us. Constant repetition of java over this trimester will engrain good code writing habits for the exam.
* The last thing I will do is view FRQ implementations done during Trimester 2. These helped with making sure my java code did not have syntax errors and so I wouldn't make errors like that on the paper AP exam.

**I will make an effort to set study goals with my teammates because I will be more accountable to get stuff down in that respect.**

## Study Plan
- Monday - Today we will be crossover grading our FRQs. I will take this time to see the many ways people solved the frq problems taking not of the code efficiency, readability for a grader, and length of code (how long it would have taken to write them). This will make me better prepared for the FRQ portion of the test
- Tuesday - Today we will likely take another practice MC. This time, I will stay focused and should be able to finish the test within the bounds of the period and get a good score on it.
- Wednesday - Another review day. This day I will do test corrections for the MC questions I missed the day before taking not if the mistakes were because of silly mistakes/distractions or reading the question too fast or because I just didn't know how to solve it. I will watched supplemental videos based on the problem and fix it immediately
- Thursday - Today I will take a practice FRQ exam - again this time I will be super focused and finish the entire thing in class (which is a lot less time than the actual exam so I know I'll be prepared for that one when it comes to time management)
- Friday - Review mistakes from the FRQ yesterday, watch videos, and continue to learn just like my plan on Wednesday.

Q-10: Correct answer is d because it has to do with wrapper classes and how children of abstract classes and interfaces can be considered as having "more" than one class definition.

Q-19: Rushed this question and should have evaluated each condition with respect to the condition that is in the while loop. I will make sure not to do this during the actual test.

Q-23: After reworking if after getting it wrong I got the write answer. I got it wrong the first time because I tried to solve it in my head rather than writing some values down on paper which would have made it a lot easier.

Q-26: Skipped this question but this problem was discussed in class and I know I would have gotten it right had I gone through the problem during he mock exam.

Q-29: I have seen similar code to this so I skimmed it really quickly and assumed that the code wanted to find the sum of each digit in the number but after further examination, I can see that 1 is being added each time which means its counting how "long" the number is rather than the sum of the digits.

Q32-39: I would have gotten all of these right but I just ran out of time due to distractions in class so I will not put any corrections for these problems.

MC Corrections
The only questions I got wrong were ones with silly mistakes and those that involved casting and objects. I hadn't studied casting data types and objects yet but after reveiwing them now I know I can get these questions correct.
